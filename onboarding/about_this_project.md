# About This Project

## What is this project?

This project is a comprehensive, full-stack retail and e-commerce management system. It is built using a modern technology stack centered around Next.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The architecture is designed to be robust, scalable, and feature-rich, catering to both customer-facing storefront operations and a powerful administrative back-office.

The database schema, detailed in `prisma/schema.prisma` and visualized in `prisma/shop.dbml`, is exceptionally thorough. It models a complete retail ecosystem, including products with complex variants, multi-store inventory, a sophisticated promotions engine, a customer loyalty program, and a full-fledged support ticketing system.

## What is this project used for?

This system is designed to serve as a foundational platform for a modern retail business that operates both online and through physical stores. Its primary uses include:

- **Online E-commerce Storefront:** Allowing customers to browse products, manage their carts and wishlists, place orders, and track their purchase history.
- **Administrative Dashboard:** Providing employees with tools to manage the entire retail operation. This includes product and inventory management, order fulfillment, customer and employee administration, content management (blog), and viewing sales reports.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Managing employee permissions to ensure staff can only access the parts of the system relevant to their roles (e.g., Sales Staff, Inventory Manager, Super Admin).
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** Handling customer data, support tickets, loyalty points, and targeted promotions through customer groups.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Tracking suppliers and managing goods receipts to update inventory levels.

Essentially, it's an all-in-one solution for running a complex retail business.
